Physical notes are easy to set-up, can be moved around in space and offer flexibility when clustering un-structured data. However, when working with mixed data sources such as surveys, designers often trade off the physicality of notes for analytical power. We propose AffinityLens, a mobile-based augmented reality (AR) application for Data-Assisted Affinity Diagramming (DAAD). Our application provides just-in-time quantitative insights overlaid on physical notes. Affinity Lens uses several different types of AR overlays (called lenses) to help users find specific notes, cluster information, and summarize insights from clusters. Through a formative study of AD users, we developed design principles for data-assisted AD and an initial collection of lenses. Based on our prototype, we find that Affinity Lens supports easy switching between qualitative and quantitative 'views' of data, without surrendering the lightweight benefits of existing AD practice.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\npages = {1–13},\nnumpages = {13},\nkeywords = {affinity diagramming, augmented reality, visual analytics},\nlocation = {Glasgow, Scotland Uk},\nseries = {CHI '19}\n}",

We evaluated our approach in two studies with professionals who routinely deliver and attend presentations about data. The first study considered the presenter perspective, where 12 participants delivered presentations to a remote audience using a presentation environment incorporating our approach. The second study considered the audience experience of 17 participants who attended presentations supported by our environment.

We inform our design through a design space with four ways to augment static visualizations.

However, virtual worlds need to utilize layouts and organizational schemes that are meaningful to the user and beneficial for data analysis. This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment. With a Filter, a user can specify the modification they wish to perform on one or more input data panels (i.e., containers of points), along with where output data panels should be placed in the virtual environment. Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities. An exploratory study conducted with six virtual reality users evaluated the usability, affordances, and performance of DataHop for data analysis tasks, and found that spatially mapping one's workflow can be beneficial when exploring multidimensional datasets.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology},\npages = {818–828},\nnumpages = {11},\nkeywords = {immersive data visualization, spatial skills},\nlocation = {Virtual Event, USA},\nseries = {UIST '20}\n}",

We selected pictographs (composed of multiple data glyphs) as this representation affords creative freedom, allowing people to craft symbolic or whimsical shapes of personal significance to represent data. We present the results of a qualitative study with 12 participants crafting pictographs using a large pen-enabled device and while immersed within a VR environment.

The motor actuated sliders support alignment to positions of significant values within the data, or coordination with other input: e.g., mid-air gestures in the data space, touch gestures on the surface below the data, or another Embodied Axes device supporting multi-user scenarios.

However, few studies have evaluated users' open-ended exploration of multi-dimensional datasets using VR and compared the results with that of traditional (2D) visualizations. Using a workload- and insight-based evaluation methodology, we conducted a user study to perform such a comparison. We find that there is no overall task-workload difference between traditional visualizations and visualizations in VR, but there are differences in the accuracy and depth of insights that users gain. Our results also suggest that users feel more satisfied and successful when using VR data exploration tools, thus demonstrating the potential of VR as an engaging medium for visual data analytics.},\nbooktitle = {Extended Abstracts of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\npages = {1–6},\nnumpages = {6},\nkeywords = {virtual reality, data dashboards, data visualisation},\nlocation = {Montreal QC, Canada},\nseries = {CHI EA '18}\n}",

We evaluate the potential of VR PCP using a formative qualitative study with seven participants. In a task involving 54 points with 29 dimensions per point, we found that participants were able to detect patterns in the dataset compared with a previously published study with two expert users using traditional 2D PCP, which acts as the gold standard for the dataset.

However, the presentation and interaction design of data visualization integrated into the physical environment may vary in different scales. Understanding how users manage their spatial relationships with AR visualization under different representational scales is crucial for designing user-friendly AR-empowered visual analytic systems. To this end, we present a study with 16 participants, inviting them to solve two logical reasoning puzzles by interacting with the associated node-link graphs in AR in room- and table-scales respectively. Through observation, interviews, and video analysis, we identify three types of spatial arrangements, which are, positioning the visualization in the figural, vista, or panoramic space of a user. We further explore how scales and visualization design affect users' spatial preferences and exploratory behaviors, and summarize our findings among the three types of spatial arrangements.},\nbooktitle = {Extended Abstracts of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\npages = {1–6},\nnumpages = {6},\nkeywords = {user behavior, augmented reality, visual analytics, scale},\nlocation = {Montreal QC, Canada},\nseries = {CHI EA '18}\n}",

The basic interface element is an embodied data axis. The user can manipulate these axes like physical objects in the immersive environment and combine them into sophisticated visualisations. The type of visualisation that appears depends on the proximity and relative orientation of the axes with respect to one another, which we describe with a formal grammar. This straight-forward composability leads to a number of emergent visualisations and interactions, which we review, and then demonstrate with a detailed multivariate data analysis use case.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology},\npages = {71–83},\nnumpages = {13},\nkeywords = {immersive analytics, multidimensional data visualization, information visualization, immersion, virtual reality, immersive visualization},\nlocation = {Qu\\'{e}bec City, QC, Canada},\nseries = {UIST '17}\n}",

The analysis of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) is currently a time-consuming and cognitively demanding task, as FRPs have a complex spatial structure, consisting of several hundred thousand fibers, each having more than twenty different extracted features. This paper presents ImNDT, a novel visualization system, which offers material experts an immersive exploration of multidimensional secondary data of FRPs. Our system is based on a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted device (HMD) to enable fluid and natural explorations through embodied navigation, the avoidance of menus, and manual mode switching. We developed immersive visualization and interaction methods tailored to the characterization of FRPs, such as a Model in Miniature, a similarity network, and a histo-book. An evaluation of our techniques with domain experts showed advantages in discovering structural patterns and similarities. Especially novices can strongly benefit from our intuitive representation and spatial rendering.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology},\narticleno = {9},\nnumpages = {11},\nkeywords = {interaction techniques, Multidimensional data visualization, immersive analytics, virtual reality, fibre-reinforced polymers},\nlocation = {Osaka, Japan},\nseries = {VRST '21}\n}",

However, it is difficult for non-experts to analyze and understand their behavior. Hence, we propose an interactive visualization system of DL models in an immersive environment. Because an immersive environment offers unlimited displays and visualization of high-dimensional data, it enables a comprehensive analysis on data propagations through the layers, and compares the multiple performance metrics. In this research, we implemented a prototype system, demonstrated it to machine learning engineers, and discussed the future benefits of visualizing DL models in an immersive environment. Accordingly, our concept received positive feedback; however, we inferred that most of the engineers consider the visualization technology as a unique introduction to the immersive environment.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology},\narticleno = {82},\nnumpages = {3},\nkeywords = {immersive analytics, deep learning},\nlocation = {Osaka, Japan},\nseries = {VRST '21}\n}",

Since AR is an emerging technology, it is important to also consider productive use cases, which is why we chose an exemplary and challenging industry 4.0 environment. Our basic perceptual research focuses on both the visual complexity of backgrounds as well as the influence of a secondary task. In contrast to our expectation, data of our 34 study participants indicate that the background has far less influence on the perception of AR visualizations. Moreover, we observed a mismatch between measured and subjectively reported performance. We discuss the importance of the background and recommendations for visual real-world augmentations. Overall, our results suggest that AR can be used in many visually challenging environments without losing the ability to productively work with the visualizations shown.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {522},\nnumpages = {15},\nkeywords = {Augmented Reality, User Study, Industrial Scenario, AR Visualization, Immersive Analytics, In-Situ Visualization, Visual Perception, Industry 4.0},\nlocation = {Yokohama, Japan},\nseries = {CHI '21}\n}",

We propose novel concepts and techniques addressing visualization-specific challenges. By showing additional 2D and 3D information around and above displays, we extend their limited screen space. AR views between displays as well as linking and brushing are also supported, making relationships between separated visualizations plausible. We introduce the design process and rationale for our techniques. To validate Marvis’ concepts and show their versatility and widespread applicability, we describe six implemented example use cases. Finally, we discuss insights from expert hands-on reviews. As a result, we contribute to a better understanding of how the combination of one or more mobile devices with AR can benefit visual data analysis. By exploring this new type of visualization environment, we hope to provide a foundation and inspiration for future mobile data visualizations.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {468},\nnumpages = {17},\nkeywords = {augmented displays, immersive analytics, mobile devices, head-mounted augmented reality, mobile data visualization, data analysis, cross-device interaction, data visualization},\nlocation = {Yokohama, Japan},\nseries = {CHI '21}\n}",

To counteract this process, researchers are increasingly concerned with finding digital solutions which aim to support healthcare professionals by enhancing the efficiency of reoccurring critical caring tasks and thus, improve working conditions. In this regard, this paper evaluates the application of Augmented Reality (AR) for patient monitoring for critical care nursing. Grounded on an observational study, semi-structured interviews, as well as a quantitative analysis, mobile patient monitoring scenarios, present particularly during patient transport, were identified as an innovative context of use of AR in the field. Additionally, user requirements such as high wearability, hands-free operability, and clear data representation could be derived from the obtained study results. For validation of these and identification of further requirements, three prototypes differing in their data illustration format were subsequently developed and quantitatively, as well as qualitatively evaluated by conducting an online survey. Thereby, it became evident that future implementations of a corresponding system for patient monitoring ought to integrate a context-dependent data presentation in particular, as this combines high navigability and availability of required data. Identifying patient monitoring during patient transport as a potential context of use, as well as distinguishing a context-dependent design approach as favorable constitute two key contributions of this work and provide a foundation on which future implementations of AR systems in the nursing domain and other related contexts can be established.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology},\narticleno = {11},\nnumpages = {11},\nkeywords = {wearable, critical care, patient monitoring, head-mounted display, augmented reality},\nlocation = {Osaka, Japan},\nseries = {VRST '21}\n}",

Even though large displays provide more display space, they are challenging with regard to perception, effective multi-user support, and managing data density and complexity. To address these issues and illustrate our proposed setup, we contribute an extensive design space comprising first, the spatial alignment of display, visualizations, and objects in AR space. Next, we discuss which parts of a visualization can be augmented. Finally, we analyze how AR can be used to display personal views in order to show additional information and to minimize the mutual disturbance of data analysts. Based on this conceptual foundation, we present a number of exemplary techniques for extending visualizations with AR and discuss their relation to our design space. We further describe how these techniques address typical visualization problems that we have identified during our literature research. To examine our concepts, we introduce a generic AR visualization framework as well as a prototype implementing several example techniques. In order to demonstrate their potential, we further present a use case walkthrough in which we analyze a movie data set. From these experiences, we conclude that the contributed techniques can be useful in exploring and understanding multivariate data. We are convinced that the extension of large displays with AR for information visualization has a great potential for data analysis and sense-making.},\nkeywords = {data visualization;data analysis;augmented reality;three-dimensional displays;navigation;visualization},\ndoi = {10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030460},\npublisher = {IEEE Computer Society},\naddress = {Los Alamitos, CA, USA},\nmonth = {feb}\n}",

We explore two main design factors for quantitative data visualisation on virtual globes: i)&nbsp;commonly used primitives (2D bar, 3D bar, circle) and ii)&nbsp;the orientation of these primitives (tangential, normal, billboarded). We evaluate five distinctive visualisation idioms in a user study with 50 participants. The results show that aligning primitives tangentially on the globe’s surface decreases the accuracy of area-proportional circle visualisations, while the orientation does not have a significant effect on the accuracy of length-proportional bar visualisations. We also find that tangential primitives induce higher perceived mental load than other orientations. Guided by these results we design a novel globe visualisation idiom, Geoburst, that combines a virtual globe and a radial bar chart. A preliminary evaluation reports potential benefits and drawbacks of the Geoburst visualisation.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {460},\nnumpages = {14},\nkeywords = {virtual globes, geovisualisation, quantitative data visualisation},\nlocation = {Yokohama, Japan},\nseries = {CHI '21}\n}",

In recent years, an increasing number of AR sketching tools enable users to draw and embed sketches in the real world. However, with the current tools, sketched contents are inherently static, floating in mid-air without responding to the real world. This paper introduces a new way to embed dynamic and responsive graphics in the real world. In RealitySketch, the user draws graphical elements on a mobile AR screen and binds them with physical objects in real-time and improvisational ways, so that the sketched elements dynamically move with the corresponding physical motion. The user can also quickly visualize and analyze real-world phenomena through responsive graph plots or interactive visualizations. This paper contributes to a set of interaction techniques that enable capturing, parameterizing, and visualizing real-world motion without pre-defined programs and configurations. Finally, we demonstrate our tool with several application scenarios, including physics education, sports training, and in-situ tangible interfaces.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology},\npages = {166–181},\nnumpages = {16},\nkeywords = {embedded data visualization, tangible interaction, real-time authoring, augmented reality, sketching interfaces},\nlocation = {Virtual Event, USA},\nseries = {UIST '20}\n}",

Immersive analytics tools have recently emerged to support such analysis in situ, yet the complexity of the data also warrants an ex-situ analysis using more traditional non-immersive visual analytics setups. To bridge the gap between both approaches, we introduce ReLive: a mixed-immersion visual analytics framework for exploring and analyzing mixed reality user studies. ReLive combines an in-situ virtual reality view with a complementary ex-situ desktop view. While the virtual reality view allows users to relive interactive spatial recordings replicating the original study, the synchronized desktop view provides a familiar interface for analyzing aggregated data. We validated our concepts in a two-step evaluation consisting of a design walkthrough and an empirical expert user study.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {24},\nnumpages = {20},\nkeywords = {virtual reality., Immersive analytics, data visualization, visual analytics},\nlocation = {New Orleans, LA, USA},\nseries = {CHI '22}\n}",

These platforms have large VR-ready user populations, distributed synchronous virtual environments, and support for user-generated content. We demonstrate how social VR platforms can be used to practically and ethically produce valid research results by replicating two studies using one such platform (VRChat): a quantitative study on Fitts’ Law and a qualitative study on tabletop collaboration. Our replication studies exhibited analogous results to the originals, indicating the research validity of this approach. Moreover, we easily recruited experienced VR users with their own hardware for synchronous, remote, and collaborative participation.

VR also supports additional sensory modalities such as haptic feedback. Inspired by methods commonly used in Scientific Visualisation to visually explore volumes, we propose two techniques that leverage the immersive aspects of VR: first, a density-based haptic vibration technique (Scaptics) which provides feedback through the controller; and second, an adaptation of a cutting plane for 3D scatterplots (Highlight-Plane). We evaluated both techniques in a controlled study with two tasks involving density (finding high- and low-density areas). Overall, Scaptics was the most time-efficient and accurate technique, however, in some conditions, it was outperformed by Highlight-Plane.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\npages = {1–12},\nnumpages = {12},\nkeywords = {virtual reality, 3d scatterplot, haptic, vibrotactile feedback},\nlocation = {Glasgow, Scotland Uk},\nseries = {CHI '19}\n}",

We provide examples of how the framework could be used to create sample applications, the types of the studies which could be supported, and example results from a simple pilot study.},\nbooktitle = {Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {234},\nnumpages = {6},\nkeywords = {cross-device interaction, smartphone, interaction methods, field of view, Augmented Reality},\nlocation = {Yokohama, Japan},\nseries = {CHI EA '21}\n}",

Shvil facilitates path planning and execution by creating a collaborative medium between an overseer (indoor user) and an explorer (outdoor user) using AR and 3D printing techniques. Shvil provides a remote overseer with a physical representation of the topography of the mission, and merges the physical presence of the explorer and the actions of the overseer via dynamic AR visualization. The system supports collaboration by both overlaying visual information related to the explorer on top of the overseer's local physical representation, and overlaying visual information in-situ for the explorer as it emerges from the overseer. We report our current prototype effort and preliminary results, and our vision for the future of Shvil.},\nbooktitle = {CHI '14 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\npages = {1291–1296},\nnumpages = {6},\nkeywords = {computer supported cooperative work (cscw), visualization, augmented reality and tangible ui, mixed reality, route finding},\nlocation = {Toronto, Ontario, Canada},\nseries = {CHI EA '14}\n}",

However, it can be challenging to use the by default supported mid-air gestures to interact with visualizations in augmented reality (e.g. due to limited precision). Touch-based interaction (e.g. via mobile devices) can compensate for these drawbacks, but is limited to two-dimensional input. In this work we present STREAM: Spatially-aware Tablets combined with Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Displays for the multimodal interaction with 3D visualizations. We developed a novel eyes-free interaction concept for the seamless transition between the tablet and the augmented reality environment. A user study reveals that participants appreciated the novel interaction concept, indicating the potential for spatially-aware tablets in augmented reality. Based on our findings, we provide design insights to foster the application of spatially-aware touch devices in augmented reality and research implications indicating areas that need further investigation.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {469},\nnumpages = {14},\nkeywords = {immersive analytics, augmented reality, visualizations, mobile devices, multimodal interaction},\nlocation = {Yokohama, Japan},\nseries = {CHI '21}\n}",

We build an interactive 3D data visualization tool that adapts hand gestures and mid-air haptics to provide tangible interaction in VR using ultrasound haptic feedback on 3D data visualization. We consider two types of 3D visualization datasets and provide different data encoding methods for haptic representations. Two user experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The first experimental results show that adding a mid-air haptic modality can be beneficial regardless of noise conditions and useful for handling occlusion or discerning density and volume information. The second experiment results further show the strengths and weaknesses of direct touch and indirect touch modes. Our findings can shed light on designing and implementing a tangible interaction on 3D data visualization with mid-air haptic feedback.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology},\narticleno = {29},\nnumpages = {11},\nkeywords = {immersive analytics, haptics, Data visualization, virtual reality},\nlocation = {Osaka, Japan},\nseries = {VRST '21}\n}",

In it, participants wore a Microsoft HoloLens device and used a Bluetooth keyboard to program a visualization script for a given dataset. To support our analysis, we (i) video recorded sessions, (ii) tracked users' interactions, and (iii) collected data of participants' impressions. Our prototype confirms that agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the immersive environment. Finally, participants benefited from our expressive toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.},\nbooktitle = {Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\npages = {1–7},\nnumpages = {7},\nkeywords = {augmented reality, user study, situated visualization},\nlocation = {Honolulu, HI, USA},\nseries = {CHI EA '20}\n}",

Our goal is to understand the advantages and concerns of applying immersive visualization to real-world skill-based sports training and to provide insights for designing AR sports training systems. We design both a situated 3D visualization on a head-mounted display and a 2D visualization on a co-located display to provide immediate visual feedback on a player’s shot performance. Using a within-subject study design with experienced basketball shooters, we characterize user goals, report on qualitative training experiences, and compare the quantitative training results. Our results show that real-time visual feedback helps athletes refine subsequent shots. Shooters in our study achieve greater angle consistency with our visual feedback. Furthermore, AR visualization promotes an increased focus on body form in athletes. Finally, we present suggestions for the design of future sports AR studies.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\narticleno = {461},\nnumpages = {13},\nkeywords = {Data Visualization, SportsXR, Augmented Reality, Immersive Analytics, Situated Analytics},\nlocation = {Yokohama, Japan},\nseries = {CHI '21}\n}",

VR-based gait assessment may provide low-risk, reproducible and controlled virtual environments, enabling experimenters to investigate underlying causes for imbalance by manipulating experimental conditions such as multi-sensory loads, mental processing loads (cognitive load), and/or motor tasks. We present a low-cost novel VR gait assessment system that simulates virtual obstacles, visual, auditory, and cognitive loads while using motion tracking to assess participants’ walking performance. The system utilizes in-situ spatial visualization for trial playback and instantaneous outcome measures which enable experimenters and participants to observe and interpret their performance. The trial playback can visualize any moment in the trial with embodied graphic segments including the head, waist, and feet. It can also replay two trials at the same time frame for trial-to-trial comparison, which helps visualize the impact of different experimental conditions. The outcome measures, i.e., the metrics related to walking performance, are calculated in real-time and displayed as data graphs in VR. The system can help experimenters get specific gait information on balance performance beyond a typical clinical gait test, making it clinically relevant and potentially applicable to gait rehabilitation. We conducted a feasibility study with physical therapy students, research graduate students, and licensed physical therapists. They evaluated the system and provided feedback on the outcome measures, the spatial visualizations, and the potential use of the system in the clinic. The study results indicate that the system was feasible for gait assessment, and the immediate spatial visualization features were seen as clinically relevant and useful. Limitations and considerations for future work are discussed.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology},\narticleno = {15},\nnumpages = {10},\nkeywords = {gait balance, obstacle crossing, playback, Spatial visualization, virtual reality},\nlocation = {Osaka, Japan},\nseries = {VRST '21}\n}",
